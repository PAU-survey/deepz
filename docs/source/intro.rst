Introduction
============

The ``toros pipeline`` is dedicated to the automatic acquisition and processing of astronomical images. The main task of this program is to apply the first corrections and astrometry to the data obtained 
from the telescopes to be installed in the TOROS project. The database structure includes the different
files produced during the observing period. The pipeline can be configured to perform calibration and 
astrometry, storing this information from images of other telescopes.


Motivation
**********

This package is intended to provide a quick, as well as (hopefully) easy to understand way, 
to achieve nightly image reduction and astrometry.

Limitations
***********

- None xD
- Lack of testing in the code specifically in ``module:toros.tests``
